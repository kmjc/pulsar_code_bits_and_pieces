ACCEL_sift.py and sifting.py are the originals

sifting_DMprec.py specified a dm precision parameter and uses that in all of the strings / DM-finding
ACCEL_sift_0.py works with that and also lets you specify DM precision.
                it's also argparse-ified so you can pass in useful stuff on the command line rather than having to edit the script every time
